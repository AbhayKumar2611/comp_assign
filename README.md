# ðŸŽ¥ Mood-Based Movie Recommendation Ad Banner

This project is an interactive display ad that captures a user's face through their webcam, analyzes their mood using the OpenAI API, and recommends a movie tailored to that mood. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and animation libraries like GSAP or jQuery, the ad offers an engaging and personalized user experience within a lightweight (â‰¤5MB) ad unit.

ðŸš€ How It Works
